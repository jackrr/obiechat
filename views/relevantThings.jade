			.head YeorVoice
			p YeorVoice was created as part of a private reading in the Computer Science department here at Oberlin. It has been a challenging exercise in web development for an online community. Now it needs to be tested by you, the live user.
			.head Motiviations
			p Throughout my time here at Oberlin the anonymous posting website ObieTalk facilitated the occurrence of a variety of unpleasant events.* I believe that anonymous online spaces do not unfailingly lead to undesirable outcomes. I recognize that inevitably someone is going to say something that a number of people will agree should not have been said. As with any space, anonymous or not, on the internet or in a public park, this is something that is going to happen in any medium of communication. On ObieTalk, though, the unpleasant thing that was said would remained in plain sight.
			.head Anonymity
			p Some of the content on YeorVoice is anonymous: posts do not show a user’s display name or name in some spaces discussions. With YeorVoice I wanted to put the power to moderate content in the hands of the users. If a user encounter content in the site that for any reason this user thinks should not be displayed, the user can click the warn link and fill out the associated form.
			.head Going forward
			p I recognize that this project is far from complete. There are always more features to add, more ways to simplify and beautify the information displayed, and better ways to facilitate content moderation. With the user feedback that you will hopefully provide all these aspects can continue to improve going forward. If you have any questions, contributions, concerns, or anything at all you’d like to speak to me about don’t hesitate to email me:
				a(href="mailto:yeorvoice@gmail.com")  yeorvoice@gmail.com.
			p With that all said, I’d like to remind you that this site exists for you to have fun. Talk to people you wouldn’t normally talk to about things you wouldn’t normally talk about. Share your thoughts. Learn something new. Make a new friend. Meet an old one.

'I don't think the administration should be monitoring Obietalk,' Dean of Students Eric Estes told The Oberlin Review in the article announcing the proposal. 'I think the key is empowering students to help shape acceptable discourse for themselves.'"
